# Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch
This was part of The Odin Project curriculum.

Building the whole thing felt a bit daunting, especially getting the loops and CSS right. I feel more comfortable solving smaller problems within the code. Using assets from a previous project definitely helped make the styling easier this time.

Learning how to actually create the grid of "pixels" with divs and making them change color on hover was challenging but fun. It was satisfying to figure out.

Completing this makes me feel more capable, and I'm starting to imagine building more complex things for my own projects, which is exciting.
